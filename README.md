simple Web app that serves up puzzles

This project uses Vagrant so it should be easy to get going. Install Vagrant from <www.vagrantup.com>, then run `vagrant up`.

This will automatically download and configure the VM for this project. Then connect using `vagrant ssh`.

Then, from the SSH terminal, you can call `bundle install` to install Rails and the rest of the gems this project requires.

If that fails, try `rbenv rehash`, then try again.
